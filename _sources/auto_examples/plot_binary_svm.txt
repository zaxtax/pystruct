==================
Binary SVM as SSVM
==================
Example of training binary SVM using n-slack QP, 1-slack QP, SGD and
SMO (libsvm). Our 1-slack QP does surprisingly well.

There are many parameters to tune and we can make 1-slack as good as the rest
for the price of higher runtime, we can also try to make the others faster.
We don't really have a chance to beat LibSVM but that's ok ;)
