===================
Latent Dynamics CRF
===================

Solving a 2d grid problem by introducing latent variable interactions.
The input data is the same as in plot_grid_crf, a cross pattern.
But now, the center is not given an extra state. That makes the problem
much harder to solve for a pairwise model.
We can still solve it by introducing latent dynamics. In essence we allow
an additional state with different interactions, that maps to the same
state (the cross) in the ground truth.
